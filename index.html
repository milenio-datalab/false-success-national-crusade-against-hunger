    </p>

    <p>The National Crusade Against Hunger, the main public policy strategy to eliminate hunger in Mexico, has
        failed since its creation. Due to an absence of a methodology to identify those who live in extreme
        poverty and suffer from undernourishment, which by federal mandate the strategy should benefit, in the
        states that concentrate such population the coverage with social programs is less than 40%, while in
        states with far fewer people suffering from those conditions the coverage is higher than 250%.</p>

    <p>In a country where over 7 million people spend their days without anything to eat and have no means to
        escape their ordeal, the largest strategy to combat hunger that has ever been registered in Mexico has
        distributed its resources by guesswork, without first detecting the conditions of those who it is
        supposed to benefit. </p>

    <p>The absence of a methodology has also allowed for the dissemination of inaccurate results in public
        speeches and other official channels of communication such as the website of the Crusade. For instance,
        the website claims that one of the main programs used to reduce hunger, the Food Support Program (PAL),
        currently benefits 4.17 million people; however, according to official records of the Crusade the
        program currently benefits only 1.15 million people. This means the government report 3.6 times more
        beneficiaries than those in the official databases of the program. More details ahead.</p>

    <div style="text-align:center; width:100%;">
        <iframe scrolling="no" marginheight="0" src="vis/distribucion-pobreza"
                style="margin: 10px auto;" frameborder="0" height="651" width="478"></iframe>
    </div>

    <p>The current investigation was conducted by obtaining and processing over 300,000 publicly available
        official databases of beneficiaries of the National Crusade Against Hunger which were separated at the
        community level. The data was systematized and aggregated into a single database in order to understand
        what happens at the center of this public policy strategy.</p>

    <p>And what happens is not small: the coverage is unequal in the different states of the country and the
        priority was not given to those most vulnerable. On one hand, where extreme poverty and hunger is
        extensive and systemic, coverage falls below 40% like in the state of Oaxaca where only 38.9% of that
        vulnerable population is benefited with social programs.</p>

    <p>On the other hand, in eleven states more people were benefited with the strategy than CONEVAL, the
        organism in charge of measuring poverty in Mexico, identifies should receive the social programs. For
        instance, in the state of Aguascalientes the excess in coverage reaches 268%, even though only 1.5% of
        the population of the state lives in extreme poverty and is malnourished. The Crusade is obliged under
        its mandate to utilize the estimates provided by CONEVAL to identify the population it should serve.</p>

    <div style="text-align:center; width:100%;">
        <iframe scrolling="no" marginheight="0" src="vis/mapa-cobertura"
                style="margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;" frameborder="0" height="696"
                width="478"></iframe>
    </div>

    <p>The disparity is larger at the municipal level. In the 150 poorest municipalities in the country, where
        more than 32% of the population lives in extreme poverty and is malnourished, the average coverage is
        41%. For example, in eight municipalities in Oaxaca none of the population receives a social program
        even though over a fifth of its population would qualify to be a beneficiary of the Crusade.</p>

    <p>In contrast, in the 150 municipalities that have the lowest level of extreme poverty, the average
        coverage is 137%; by this standard, more people are being benefited than CONEVAL estimates should
        qualify to be part of the strategy. In Juchipila in the state of Zacatecas, for instance, the coverage
        is 1500% higher than it should. </p>

    <h2>Falsifying Beneficiaries</h2>

    <p>In an interview with Omar Garfias, Technical Secretary of the Inter-secretarial Commission of the
        National Crusade Against Hunger, he mentioned that the initial design of the strategy, due to the
        characteristics of the programs that it is comprised of, did not take into consideration the
        identification of people whose characteristics would qualify them to participate in the Crusade and
        instead conducted a territorial policy where resources were assigned on a regional basis. In each
        region, local coordinators selected who would benefit from the policy.</p>

    <p class="quote">“When we entered (into the Crusade) that was one of the great insufficiencies of the social
        policy. You
        say, there are very important sums of money destined to social policy but -who is receiving it?- There
        wasn't a scheme to characterize the beneficiaries so there was a lot of resources assigned on guesswork.
        You say, he looks ruined, he is a poor farmer, so you give (the programs) to him...when we started there
        were no databases of beneficiaries, there were only unconnected lists of people who were receiving the
        programs but there wasn't a unique (methodology) to characterize (the beneficiaries)”</p>

    <div style="text-align:center; width:100%;">
        <iframe scrolling="no"
                style="border-top: 2px solid #d62927;border-bottom: 2px solid #d62927; margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"
                src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/250741838&amp;color=d62927&amp;auto_play=false&amp;hide_related=true&amp;show_comments=false&amp;show_user=false&amp;show_reposts=false"
                frameborder="no" height="125" width="100%"></iframe>
    </div>

    <p>And so the Crusade began, without the basic instrumentation that a program designed to eradicate hunger
        is supposed to have, and without knowing first who is actually suffering from malnourishment. This lack
        of methodology to identify the vulnerable population gave way to inflated results in the official
        discourse of the organism in charge of coordinating the Crusade, SEDESOL.</p>

    <p>According to Garfias: <i>“Yes, it was a problem because it permitted the assignment of beneficiaries at
        will… by this I mean it allowed for falsification ( of beneficiaries), so you can say -these people are
        poor- and who should you give (the programs) to? How can you tell they are poor? We don't know their
        characteristics, so when someone comes and says “I gave (the programs) to my friend” how can you tell
        him yes or no? The ideal is to have (an instrument to identify the characteristics of people) and that
        is what we are striving to achieve”.</i></p>

    <div style="text-align:center; width:100%;">
        <iframe scrolling="no"
                style="border-top: 2px solid #d62927;border-bottom: 2px solid #d62927; margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"
                src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/250741941&amp;color=d62927&amp;auto_play=false&amp;hide_related=true&amp;show_comments=false&amp;show_user=false&amp;show_reposts=false"
                frameborder="no" height="125" width="100%"></iframe>
    </div>

    <p>The ideal path before starting a public policy would be to know beforehand the target population.
        However, for Garfias that would have incurred in a political cost: </p>

    <p class="quote">“If we didn't start the Crusade we had two problems: first we would lose two and a half
        years of work, and it wouldn't have acquired the centrality of a priority strategy for the President.
        Priority strategies are announced on the first day. We decided: lets begin the Crusade but lets also
        modify the institutional tools that are insufficient”.</p>

    <div style="text-align:center; width:100%;">
        <iframe scrolling="no"
                style="border-top: 2px solid #d62927;border-bottom: 2px solid #d62927; margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"
                src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/250742044&amp;color=d62927&amp;auto_play=false&amp;hide_related=true&amp;show_comments=false&amp;show_user=false&amp;show_reposts=false"
                frameborder="no" height="125" width="100%"></iframe>
    </div>

    <p>In a context where almost 3 million people who live in extreme poverty and are malnourished currently
        don't receive any social programs, the cost of the insufficient tools to characterize beneficiaries has
        led to a situation where in 11 states at least 279,000 people are currently receiving programs who
        shouldn't according to the operational rules of the Crusade and that at the moment, there are no tools
        to even verify if they are poor or not.</p>

    <h2>Programs that do not Fight Hunger</h2>

    <p>Another problem is that under the current structure, hundreds of thousands of people are being counted as
        beneficiaries of the National Crusade Against Hunger even though they are not receiving any program that
        substantially helps them to fight malnourishment. </p>

    <p>The Crusade as a strategy is comprised of 61 programs of which, according to the Federal Audit Office,
        only 9 of them directly combat hunger and the rest relate to other endeavors such as health, agriculture
        or entrepreneurship.</p>

    <p>If a person receives at least one of the sixty one programs, they are counted as beneficiaries of the
        Crusade, and as such “one less Mexican is suffering from hunger”, even though he might have received an
        agricultural subsidy that does little to combat the main issue they face: malnourishment. </p>

    <p>However, according to the Strategic Plan of the Crusade, defined in the Logical Frame Matrix of the
        strategy, for a family to overcome extreme poverty and malnourishment it has to improve seven
        components: to increase their income above the Minimum Welfare Line, a benchmark defined by CONEVAL;
        access to an adequate nutrition, access to health services, access to social security, basic services
        such as water and electricity in their home, adequate living space, and access to education. Dozens of
        the programs included in the Crusade do little or nothing to abate any of these deficiencies. </p>

    <p>Approximately 22% of the beneficiaries, over 877000 people, counted in the official databases of the
        Crusade do not receive any of the programs that directly combat hunger, the primary objective of the
        strategy. Among those programs that they don't receive are Prospera, Food Support Program (PAL),
        Pensions for Older Adults, or Community Kitchens Program.</p>

    <p>The majority of them receive other programs, predominantly Popular Insurance, a public health insurance,
        which might help improve their health and reduce medical expenses, but does little to fight
        malnourishment.</p>

    <div style="text-align:center; width:100%;">
        <iframe scrolling="no" marginheight="0" src="http://servicios2.milenio.com/datalab/viz38/index.html"
                style="margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;" frameborder="0" height="809"
                width="478"></iframe>
    </div>

    <p>Even in the municipalities that have coverage of over a 100%, the beneficiaries of the Crusade might not
        receive any program that combats hunger. For example, in the municipality of Cosio in the state of
        Aguascalientes, which has an excess coverage of 364%, the majority of beneficiaries only receive Popular
        Insurance.</p>

    <h2>Unfulfilled Goals</h2>

    <p>A <a target="_blank" href="http://informe.asf.gob.mx/Documentos/Auditorias/2014_0226_a.pdf">report by the
        Federal Audit Office</a> indicates that the Crusade has been insufficient in combating hunger
        and its reach has been smaller than estimated in its initial goals.</p>

    <p>In the design of the strategy, as <a target="_blank"
                                            href="http://dof.gob.mx/nota_detalle.php?codigo=5343098&fecha=30/04/2014">mentioned
        in the “Fifth Axis: Innovation and Coverage Strategy”</a>, by
        2014 the Crusade was supposed to reach 5.3 million people and by 2015 7.1 million people. In 2015 they
        only reached 4.5 million people. This implies that by 2016, in Mexico there should no longer exist
        people who live in extreme poverty and are hungry who don't receive any social programs. This goal is
        far from achieved. </p>

    <p>Additionally, the Federal Audit Office exposed weakness in the programs that comprise the Crusade since
        they haven't accredited a methodology to select beneficiaries, they do not have mechanisms for the
        evaluation of their impact in reducing extreme poverty or malnourishment, and their budget design lacks
        tools to analyze their financial management. </p>

    <p>One of the recommendations by the Federal Audit Office to increase the coverage of the programs designed
        to eradicate hunger is to investigate and implement actions to improve coordination of their main
        programs.</p>

    <h2>Programs that Combat Hunger</h2>

    <p>The budget of the main program to combat poverty in Mexico, Prospera, and its complementary program for
        areas without access to health and education services, Food Support Program (PAL), are large enough to
        cover all the target population of the National Crusade Against Hunger. With its current budget,
        Prospera benefits 23 million people, more than 3 times the number of people currently living in extreme
        poverty and are malnourished.</p>

    <p>The National Development Plan 2013-2018, which establishes all social development goals for the current
        government, indicates that it is a national priority to eradicate extreme poverty and hunger. However,
        even though the current operating budget of its main program is more than enough to achieve such a goal,
        less than 50% of the target population of the Crusade currently receives either Prospera or the Food
        Support Program.</p>

    <p>When the Technical Secretary Omar Garfias was asked about this predicament, he commented: <i>“Many of the
        main poverty program that combat hunger followed indicators different to alimentary goals. Now we are
        striving to correct that. What challenges do we face? That all those programs have beneficiaries, so we
        have to tell some people, hey you weren't supposed to get that program...”</i></p>

    <div style="text-align:center; width:100%;">
        <iframe scrolling="no"
                style="border-top: 2px solid #d62927;border-bottom: 2px solid #d62927; margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"
                src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/250742137&amp;color=d62927&amp;auto_play=false&amp;hide_related=true&amp;show_comments=false&amp;show_user=false&amp;show_reposts=false"
                frameborder="no" height="125" width="100%"></iframe>
    </div>

    <h2>Its All About Marketing </h2>

    <p>Currently, the only data that can be used to analyze the programs of the Crusade is the one that is
        shared in their official website and communiques. </p>

    <div style="text-align:center; width:100%;">
        <iframe scrolling="no" marginheight="0" src="vis/chorometro"
                style="margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;" frameborder="0" height="590"
                width="478"></iframe>
    </div>

    <p>However, that data can be misleading. In the case of the Community Kitchen Program, the beneficiary
        database indicates that 36,000 people of the Crusade receive the program. In contrast the Crusade
        website claims to benefit over 1 million people, more than 28 times the number of people that officially
        receive it. In the case of other programs like Liconsa, a milk distribution program, the reported number
        beneficiaries is 4.8 times larger than the official records and in the case of Pensions for Older Adults
        11.3 times larger. </p>

    <p>When Omar Garfias was asked about this situation, he mentioned that the information in the website is
        correct but it includes beneficiaries that received the programs prior to the inception of the Crusade
        that may not live in extreme poverty or suffer from malnourishment. That situation dramatically impacts
        the reported numbers. </p>

    <p>As he puts it: <i>“Yes, (the data) should have asterisks. What we don't have today is the data with which we
        have to substitute it as it should be, the again its a marketing exercise...”</i></p>

    <div style="text-align:center; width:100%;">
        <iframe scrolling="no"
                style="border-top: 2px solid #d62927;border-bottom: 2px solid #d62927; margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"
                src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/250742350&amp;color=d62927&amp;auto_play=false&amp;hide_related=true&amp;show_comments=false&amp;show_user=false&amp;show_reposts=false"
                frameborder="no" height="125" width="100%"></iframe>
    </div>

    <p>The Technical Secretary assured us that social policies are made that way: “the tire is fixed at the same
        time one goes on its way”, but that is not a norm. In 2007, Cambodia implemented “IDPoor”, a program
        designed to identify the most vulnerable populations so that they could be the priority of their social
        programs. It was designed in collaboration with the German Development Corporation (GIZ) and has been a
        case study in poverty alleviation by the World Bank. And not as a Marketing exercise. </p>
